    "overall_attractiveness": "NSCLC is HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE indication for immunotherapy and precision oncology investment with $18-21B market (US + EU) by 2027, multiple validated MOAs (ADCs, bispecifics, checkpoint-IO), and significant unmet needs despite therapeutic advances. The landscape has matured beyond first-generation checkpoint inhibitors (saturated, 5 approved agents) toward precision approaches targeting molecularly defined populations and addressing resistance mechanisms. HIGHEST PRIORITY opportunities: (1) ADC development ($8-12B market potential) - Dato-DXd and sacituzumab establish TROP2 as validated target with ORR 36-45% in resistant disease, ADC-IO combinations showing ORR 57% threatening to replace chemo-IO in 1L, novel targets (CEACAM5, B7-H3) represent white space, (2) Bispecific antibodies ($5-8B market) - amivantamab demonstrates OS superiority over osimertinib (HR 0.75, practice-changing), ivonescimab (PD-1/VEGF) shows TME modifier + checkpoint synergy (ORR 50% vs pembrolizumab 38%), T-cell engagers validated by tarlatamab (OS HR 0.60 in SCLC), (3) Early-stage programs ($1-2B market, growing) - neoadjuvant/adjuvant offers highest cure potential (pCR 24-41% with IO) with favorable competitive landscape (only nivolumab approved). CRITICAL UNMET NEEDS: EGFR TKI resistance (15-20K patients/year, $3-5B, validated solutions but room for improvement), checkpoint-refractory disease (30K+ patients/year, $6-10B, heterogeneous requiring biomarker stratification), non-G12C KRAS-mutant (22K patients/year, $4-6B, multiple approaches emerging), COLD/excluded TME (40K patients/year, $5-8B, receiving ineffective chemo-IO). KEY SUCCESS FACTORS: (1) Biomarker-driven precision - unselected trials fail (TIGIT), biomarker-selected succeed (pembrolizumab PD-L1 ≥50%), mandate predictive biomarker from Phase I, (2) Address COLD TME - 60-70% of NSCLC resistant to checkpoint monotherapy, requires MOAs independent of pre-existing immunity (ADCs, T-cell engagers, TME modifiers), (3) Combination strategies with mechanistic rationale - successful combinations target orthogonal mechanisms (EGFR + c-Met, KRAS inhibitor + checkpoint, ADC + IO), avoid redundant combinations (PD-1 + TIGIT/LAG-3 fail), (4) Prevention over treatment - 1L resistance-preemptive combinations (amivantamab) superior to treating established resistance, neoadjuvant superior to advanced disease. AVOID: TIGIT programs (class-wide Phase III failures, terminate immediately), unselected next-gen checkpoints without biomarkers (LAG-3, TIM-3 underwhelming), CAR-T in advanced NSCLC (fundamental barriers unsolved, ORR 10-20%), PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy programs (saturated market, no differentiation). EXECUTION RISKS: (1) ADC ILD management (2-5% incidence, mitigated by monitoring), (2) Bispecific CRS (manageable with step-up dosing but requires infrastructure), (3) Biomarker validation (requires FDA Biomarker Qualification, co-development timeline 3-5 years), (4) Manufacturing complexity (ADCs, personalized vaccines, cell therapies have high COGS). COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY: $15-25B peak sales potential across validated MOAs - ADCs $8-12B (Dato-DXd $2-3B, novel targets $6-9B), bispecifics $5-8B (amivantamab $3-5B, others $2-3B), vaccines $2-4B (if successful), early-stage IO $1-2B. First-to-market advantage critical (pembrolizumab dominates checkpoint space with 60% share despite comparable efficacy to competitors). STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION: INVEST HEAVILY in ADCs and bispecifics (highest ROI, validated efficacy, large markets), SELECTIVELY in vaccines and TME modifiers (higher risk, conditional on clinical validation), AVOID next-gen checkpoints and cell therapies (repeated failures, fundamental barriers). Prioritize biomarker-driven programs in molecularly defined populations over broad unselected approaches. Target 1L and early-stage settings for largest commercial opportunity and greatest patient benefit. NSCLC remains PREMIER indication for precision immuno-oncology with clear paths to $5-10B franchises for best-in-class assets addressing validated unmet needs with differentiated biology"

The tiragolumab SKYSCRAPER-01 failure (Phase III OS endpoint missed despite PFS benefit) is DEFINITIVE evidence that TIGIT pathway is biologically irrelevant in NSCLC. Belrestotug termination after Phase II PFS failure CONFIRMS class effect. LAG-3 (relatlimab) shows at best marginal benefit (~5% ORR improvement) insufficient for differentiation. BIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION: NSCLC is 60-70% COLD/EXCLUDED tumor where lack of T-cell infiltration (not exhaustion pathway choice) is rate-limiting. Adding blockade of alternative exhaustion receptors (TIGIT, LAG-3) to PD-1 inhibition provides minimal incremental benefit because insufficient T-cells are present to activate. Contrast with melanoma (HOT tumor) where relatlimab succeeds - biology matters. STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE: (1) TERMINATE all TIGIT programs immediately - class-wide failure is unambiguous, (2) DEPRIORITIZE LAG-3, TIM-3, CD73 programs absent HIGHLY validated biomarker (e.g., LAG-3+ TIL >20% with functional assay), (3) REDIRECT resources to MOAs addressing COLD tumor biology (ADCs, bispecifics, TME modifiers) rather than additional checkpoint blockade, (4) LEARN FROM FAILURES: Phase II ORR/PFS signals without OS benefit are FALSE PROMISE - do not advance to Phase III without OS readout, (5) ACCEPT that PD-1/PD-L1 is DOMINANT checkpoint in NSCLC - other pathways are biologically redundant.

CAR-T and TIL face FUNDAMENTAL barriers: (1) Trafficking: <1% CAR-T cells reach tumor (verified by PET imaging) due to abnormal vasculature lacking adhesion molecules and chemokine mismatch - insufficient effector:target ratio for efficacy, (2) TME exhaustion: hypoxia downregulates CAR expression, lactate inhibits T-cell metabolism, TGF-β converts to Treg phenotype - rapid functional loss within days, (3) Manufacturing: TIL expansion fails in 20-30% of NSCLC (vs <10% melanoma), autologous CAR-T requires 3-4 week patient-specific production with 10-15% failure rate, (4) Clinical efficacy DISAPPOINTING: MSLN CAR-T ORR 0-15% (stable disease without responses), TIL ORR 10-20% (vs 31% melanoma, 50% inferior). COST-EFFECTIVENESS UNFAVORABLE: $300-500K per patient + 20% manufacturing failures + ORR 10-20% vs ADCs $150-200K with ORR 30-45% and no manufacturing risk. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) AVOID autologous CAR-T in advanced NSCLC - trafficking barrier unsolved, multiple program failures (MSLN, others), (2) CONDITIONAL on TIL therapy: biomarker-select for TMB ≥10 + PD-L1 ≥50% (ORR may reach 25-35%), NEOADJUVANT setting (harvest from treatment-naive tumor, better TIL quality), otherwise deprioritize, (3) IF pursuing cell therapy, SOLVE FUNDAMENTAL barriers: trafficking (chemokine receptor engineering CCR2/CXCR2, local delivery intratumoral/intrapleural, oncolytic virus co-administration), TME resistance (armored CAR-T secreting IL-12/IL-15, PD-1 knockout, dual-target CARs MSLN+EpCAM), persistence (allogeneic with enhanced fitness, reduced exhaustion), (4) ALTERNATIVE cell platforms: CAR-macrophages (phagocytose tumor, M1 polarization), CAR-NK cells (allogeneic, MHC-independent, lower toxicity, off-the-shelf feasible), (5) ALLOCATE <10% R&D budget to cell therapies in NSCLC unless breakthrough demonstrated (ORR >40% with solved trafficking/manufacturing). MARKET REALITY: No CAR-T approved in any solid tumor; TIL approved only in melanoma (lifileucel). NSCLC-specific challenges (COLD TME, lower neoantigen burden than melanoma, manufacturing difficulty) make approval UNLIKELY without fundamental innovation.

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS: (1) CAF-targeting is HIGH-POTENTIAL strategy for 30-40% 'excluded' NSCLC population resistant to checkpoint monotherapy, (2) COMBINATION with checkpoint is MANDATORY - TME modifier alone removes barrier but doesn't activate T-cells, checkpoint provides activation signal, (3) BIOMARKER co-development essential - composite score (CAF density + autophagy signature + collagen content) identifies optimal patients, (4) SELECTIVE inhibitors needed - systemic autophagy blockade has toxicity (retinopathy, QT prolongation), CAF-selective delivery (FAP-targeted conjugates) would improve therapeutic window, (5) Clinical validation in progress - hydroxychloroquine + checkpoint trials will prove concept, then optimize with better inhibitors"

Hydroxychloroquine + checkpoint Phase I/II ongoing provides proof-of-concept, optimize with selective ULK1/ATG4B inhibitors, (2) PURSUE metabolic modulators - lactate targeting has compelling biology (histone lactylation causes T-cell dysfunction, validated in 30-40% lactate-high NSCLC) but needs drug development (LDH/MCT inhibitors with improved PK). Consider CB-839 (glutaminase inhibitor) + checkpoint as nearer-term alternative, (3) LEVERAGE vascular normalization - ivonescimab (PD-1/VEGF) validates concept (ORR 50% vs 38%), consider other TME + checkpoint bispecifics (PD-1/TGF-β, PD-1/IL-8, PD-1/CAF-target), (4) BIOMARKER CO-DEVELOPMENT CRITICAL: composite TME diagnostic (CAF density + autophagy signature + lactate signature + PD-L1 + TILs) classifies patients into: CAF-excluded (autophagy inhibitor + checkpoint), metabolic-dysfunctional (lactate modulator + checkpoint), vascular-excluded (VEGF inhibitor + checkpoint), immune-desert (ADC or bispecific T-cell engager), (5) SEQUENTIAL dosing likely optimal - TME modifier FIRST (2-4 weeks) to convert COLD to HOT with serial biopsies confirming TIL increase, THEN add checkpoint to release infiltrated T-cells, (6) COMBINATION STRATEGY: all TME modifiers require pairing with T-cell activator (checkpoint, bispecific, vaccine) - barrier removal alone insufficient. MARKET OPPORTUNITY: $5-8B if successful - addresses 40,000 patients/year receiving ineffective chemo-IO in COLD/excluded population, provides rational biomarker-driven alternative. EXECUTION TIMELINE: CAF autophagy inhibitors 2-4 years (clinical validation ongoing), metabolic modulators 3-5 years (drug development phase), vascular normalization 1-2 years (ivonescimab model, in Phase III). RISKS: (1) Systemic toxicity from ubiquitous pathway inhibition (autophagy, metabolism), (2) Biomarker validation complexity (multiple TME phenotypes require different modifiers), (3) Combination increases cost/toxicity, must show superior efficacy vs standard care.
