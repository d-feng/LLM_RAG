      "summary": "GBM is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with median survival 12-15 months despite maximal therapy (surgery, radiation, temozolomide). It is characterized by diffuse infiltration, pseudopalisading necrosis, microvascular proliferation, and profound immunosuppression. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts immune cell trafficking and therapeutic antibody penetration. The tumor microenvironment is dominated by immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, Tregs, and MDSCs, making GBM an immunologically 'cold' tumor. High-dose corticosteroids (used for cerebral edema) further blunt immune responses. Antigen escape is common - EGFRvIII lost in ~50% of recurrent tumors.",
