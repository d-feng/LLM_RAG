SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) Drive Cancer Progression
Key Facts:

🔴 TAMs constitute 30-50% of tumor mass
🔴 Promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis
🔴 Suppress anti-tumor T cell immunity
🔴 Cause resistance to immunotherapy

Current TAM-Targeting Approaches Have Failed

❌ CSF1R inhibitors: Limited efficacy, macrophages rebound
❌ CCL2 blockers: Failed in clinical trials
❌ No FDA-approved TAM therapeutics exist

The Gap: We Don't Know What Makes TAMs "Bad"

No systematic screen has identified genes regulating TAM pro-tumor functions


SLIDE 3: OUR SOLUTION

SLIDE 23: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q1: Why not just use CRISPR knockout instead of siRNA?

A: CRISPR: Permanent, takes 7-10 days, harder to deliver. siRNA: Transient (good for safety), faster (3 days), easier to conjugate. For screening, siRNA better.

Q2: What if CD206 isn't specific enough? It's on liver cells too.

A: True. But biodistribution studies (Month 9) will quantify. TAMs internalize CD206 rapidly → more uptake. Liver uptake acceptable if tumor/liver ratio >3. Backup: CD163 antibody.

Q3: How do you know hits aren't just general toxicity?

A: Multiple controls: (1) Non-targeting IgG-siRNA tests antibody toxicity, (2) Scrambled siRNA tests siRNA toxicity, (3) Multiple siRNAs per gene (off-target unlikely to match), (4) Mechanism studies distinguish specific vs. general.

Q4: What if no targets show in vivo efficacy?

A: Still valuable: (1) Biology discovered (publications), (2) ARC platform validated (other applications), (3) Combination therapy (ARC + anti-PD-1) more likely to work than monotherapy. But based on CSF1R data, expect ≥1 hit to work.

Q5: Why 12 months? Can you go faster?

A: Could do in 10 months if everything perfect. But: (1) ARC optimization needs time (Month 2-3), (2) In vivo studies have fixed timelines (tumor growth), (3) Want thorough validation, not fast-but-wrong. 15% contingency built in.

Q6: How is this different from previous macrophage screens?

A: Previous: Cell lines + lipofection (non-specific). Ours: Primary TAMs + ARCs (specific). Enables: (1) True TAM biology, (2) In vivo validation, (3) Therapeutic path.

Why Personnel Costs Are High (45%):

Highly specialized skills required (bioconjugation, immunology)
Labor-intensive: 500 ARCs to synthesize manually
Full-time effort needed for screening execution
Competitive salaries to retain talent

Why siRNA Library Is Expensive ($75K):

Custom modifications (5'-thiol, 2'-OMe, PS backbone)
HPLC purification (higher purity = better results)
700 unique sequences (500 + 200 validation)
Small scale synthesis (nmol) costs more per molecule

Why In Vivo Is Expensive ($80K):

Mice alone: $300-500 each for genetically defined strains
Tumor models require specialized housing
Labor-intensive (injections, measurements, harvests)
Tissue processing and analysis costly

Why Contingency Is 15%:

Novel technology = higher risk of needing repeats
Biological variability may require larger sample sizes
Industry standard for R&D: 10-20% contingency

SLIDE 29: CONTINGENCY PLANS
"What If...?" Scenarios & Backup Plans
Scenario 1: ARC Transfection Efficiency <50%
Problem: ARCs don't deliver siRNA efficiently to TAMs
Early Warning Signs:

Pilot screen (Month 3): Poor knockdown by qPCR (<50%)
Positive controls (PLK1, CSF1R) don't reduce viability

Root Causes:

Insufficient internalization
Endosomal entrapment
siRNA degradation

Contingency Plan:

Add endosomolytic agents (Week 1-2)

Test: Chloroquine (50 μM), INF7 peptide
May rescue 2-3× improvement


Optimize linker chemistry (Week 2-3)

Switch to pH-sensitive linker (hydrazone)
Releases siRNA in acidic endosomes


Alternative antibody (Week 3-4)

Test anti-CD163 (also M2 marker)
May have better internalization kinetics


Backup: PLGA-mannose nanoparticles (Month 4-5)

Less specific but higher transfection
Delays timeline by 1 month



Budget Impact: +$20K (from contingency fund)

Scenario 2: Hit Validation Rate <30%
Problem: Most primary hits don't confirm with multiple siRNAs
Early Warning Signs:

Month 7 validation: <15 genes validate out of 50

Root Causes:

High false positive rate (off-target effects)
Primary screen threshold too lenient
Cell batch variability

Contingency Plan:

Re-analyze primary data (Week 1)

Increase stringency (Z-score <-3 instead of -2)
Select top 30 genes, re-validate


Test additional siRNAs (Week 2-4)

Order 2 more siRNAs for failed genes
Total 6 siRNAs per gene
≥3/6 hit = validated


Orthogonal validation (Week 4-6)

Test small molecule inhibitors (if available)
CRISPR knockout for top 5-10 genes
Confirms targets are real



Budget Impact: +$30K for additional siRNAs

Scenario 3: No In Vivo Tumor Growth Inhibition
Problem: Top targets don't show efficacy in mouse models
Early Warning Signs:

Month 9: All tested ARCs show <20% tumor inhibition

Root Causes:

Poor in vivo targeting (ARCs don't reach TAMs)
Insufficient knockdown in vivo
TAMs less important in mouse model than expected

Contingency Plan:

Optimize dosing (Week 1-2)

Increase dose: 10 → 20 → 30 mg/kg
More frequent: q3d → q2d
Confirm knockdown at each dose


Combination therapy (Week 3-4)

ARC + anti-PD-1 (synergy expected)
ARC + chemotherapy
Combinations often more effective than monotherapy


Alternative model (Week 4-6)

Test different tumor type (higher TAM content)
LLC or B16 melanoma (very TAM-rich)


Pivot to biology paper (Week 6+)

Emphasize mechanism discoveries
In vitro TAM dependencies still valuable
Technology validation for ARCs
Position for Year 2 optimization



Budget Impact: +$40K for additional mice/models

Scenario 4: Key Personnel Leaves
Problem: Critical team member departs mid-project
Mitigation Strategies:

Cross-training: RA1 learns RA2's techniques (ongoing)
Detailed SOPs: All protocols documented in lab notebook/database
Consultant backup: Antibody engineer can scale up if Senior Scientist leaves
Recruitment plan: Pre-identified candidates, rapid hiring process

Timeline Impact: 1-2 month delay (training replacement)

Scenario 5: IACUC Delays In Vivo Studies
Problem: Animal protocol approval delayed beyond Month 9
Mitigation:

Submit early: Month 5 submission (4-month lead time)
Pre-approval meeting: Meet with IACUC chair Month 4
Alternative: Collaborate with other lab with approved protocol
Backup: CRO for in vivo work (Charles River, Crown Bio)
