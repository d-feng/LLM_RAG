      "Abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex, polygenic disease with substantial health impact. Despite extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying risk loci, therapeutic translation remains limited. We applied a Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) multi-trait gene set model to prioritize druggable gene sets, integrating GWAS summary statistics with drug-gene interaction data from the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). For each drug group, defined at the ATC 4th level, we calculated posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP) to assess relevance. Known antidiabetic agents showed strong associations with T2D, validating the model. Additionally, carboxamide derivatives, fibrates, uric acid inhibitors, and various immunomodulatory and antineoplastic agents demonstrated significant genetic relevance. Gene-level analyses highlighted key T2D-associated genes, including PPARG, KCNQ1, TNF, and GCK. Notably, bezafibrate, a PPAR pan-agonist, demonstrated substantial genetic overlap with T2D loci, supporting its potential in metabolic disease. This study introduces a genetically informed pipeline for drug repurposing based on multi-trait gene set analysis.\n",

Previous studies have shown that 3HB can reduce blood glucose level in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. However, there is no systematic study and clear mechanism to evaluate and explain the hypoglycemic effect of 3HB. Here we demonstrate that 3HB reduces fasting blood glucose level, improves glucose tolerance, and ameliorates insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic mice through hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2).

      "Insulin-resistance HepG2 cell model and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mouse model are applied for the investigation. The results illustrate that capsaicin and quercetin can exert hypoglycemic effects via reducing the concentrations of serum lipids of total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreasing hepatic enzyme activities of phosphoenolpyruvate, carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, as well as improving the histopathological morphology of liver and pancreas tissues. After administration with capsaicin and quercetin, the relative protein expression abundance of Ras, Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 is obviously attenuated compared to diabetic mice. Capsaicin and quercetin at a ratio of 3:1 are generally determined as the optimal combination.\n",

      "Abstract: Using a targeted proteomics approach, we aimed to identify and validate circulating proteins associated with impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and type 2 diabetes in a Black South African cohort. In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "This cross-sectional study included Black South African men (n=380) and women (n=375) who were part of the Middle-Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=546), IGM (n=116) or type 2 diabetes (n=93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n=1706; impaired fasting glucose, n=550; type 2 diabetes, n=210).\n",
      "We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient -0.35; 95% CI -0.44, -0.25) and men (coefficient -0.09; 95% CI -0.15, -0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men (p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men.\n",
      "We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.\n",

      "Abstract: Arterial stiffness is associated with cardiovascular events. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and galectin-3 are involved in the pathogenesis of end organ damage. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of arterial stiffness, MMPs, TIMPs and galectin-3 with the current vascular status in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n",
      "74 patients with T2DM, 36 with coronary heart disease (CHD) (T2DM + CHD) and 38 without CHD (T2DM - CHD) were included. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao), aortic and brachial augmentation indices (AIx aortic and AIx brachial) and central-aortic blood pressure values were determined by non-invasive arteriography. MMPs, TIMPs and galectin-3 plasma concentrations were analysed by ELISA.\n",
      "Patients with T2DM and CHD presented with significantly increased arterial stiffness determined as AIx and significantly elevated values for TIMP-4 and galectin-3. Heterogeneous peripheral vascular status regardless of the CHD status was observed, and increasing severity of CHD was associated with an increased arterial stiffness. TIMP-4 correlated significantly with an elevated PWVao in the whole cohort independently from CHD status.\n",
      "Determination of arterial stiffness is an effective and, compared to laboratory markers, more reliable method for determining the peripheral vascular situation in patients with T2DM, but it does not clearly depict coronary situation.\n",

      "Abstract: After BRCA 1&2, CHEK2 is the most frequently predisposing altered gene causing  breast cancer in female. The prime objective of the current study was to analyze germline CHEK2 variants and their association with breast cancer in Balochistani population.\n",
      "Breast cancer is among the most prevalent cancers worldwide and most common diagnosed cancer in women. Mutations in many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lead to the development of cancer. Along with the highly penetrance genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of breast cancer, mutations in other genes including CHEK2, a tumor suppressor gene have also been reported to be associated with breast cancer. In current study CHEK2 gene was analyzed for variation in breast cancer patients and controls of Balochistani population. Sequencing results of the DNA samples of the registered cases of breast cancer in CENAR were analyzed using Chromas software and bioinformatics tools including BLAT and  RNAfold web server.\n",
      "An intronic variant c.319+38-43dupA falling 38 nucleotide away at splice donor site of the CHEK2 gene exon 2,  in 9%  breast cancer cases, was identified which has also been previously reported in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cases. All the cases with identified variant, were affected with invasive ductal carcinoma. Higher tumor grade (III) was reported in >50% of the patients and > 70% of patients diagnosed with advanced stage of cancer. The RNA prediction results revealed the variant falling in the intronic region may code for miRNA that could play an important role in cancer progression.\n",
      "Our results suggest that the intronic variant identified in breast cancer cases as well as reported previously may act as a cancer marker and causing a splice site disruption or altering the posttranscriptional modification of mRNA encoded by CHEK2 gene.\n",

      "Abstract: Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNENs) are the second most common type of pancreatic cancer after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Germline mutations in DNA repair genes drive several hereditary and sporadic cancers; however, their role in pNENs remains poorly defined. This pilot study aimed to assess the frequency and clinical relevance of germline DNA repair gene mutations in patients with pNENs, both with and without a family history of cancer. Germline DNA from 57 Polish patients with pNENs was analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing to identify variants in a panel of DNA repair genes. Variant classification followed the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. Germline mutations were identified in 14 patients (24.6%), both with and without a family history of malignancy. Two patients carried pathogenic variants in \n",

Data on operative time, bleeding, specimen weight, reconstruction satisfaction (BRECON 31), complications, and recurrence were collected.\n",
      "All surgeries were completed without conversion to open surgery. Mean age was 41 ± 9.2 years; mean surgical time was 115.6 ± 11.0 minutes; mean blood loss was 110 ± 70.9 mL. No complications were reported. BRECON 31 satisfaction score at 6 months was 15.3/16. Median follow-up was 13 months with no recurrences.\n",

      "Abstract: Multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs) provide promising new sources of functional evidence, potentially empowering improved classification of germline genomic variants, particularly rare missense variants, which are commonly assigned as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). However, paradoxically, quantification of clinically applicable evidence strengths for MAVEs requires construction of \"truthsets\" comprising missense variants already robustly classified as pathogenic and benign. In this study, we demonstrate how benign truthset size is the primary driver of applicable functional evidence toward pathogenicity (PS3). We demonstrate, when using existing ClinVar classifications as a source of benign missense truthset variants, that only 19.8% (23/116) of established cancer susceptibility genes had a PS3 evidence strength of \"strong\" attainable when simulating validation for a hypothetical new MAVE (also applying favorable assumption of perfect concordance). We describe a systematic framework for benign truthset construction in which all possible missense variants in a gene of interest are concurrently assessed for assignation of (likely) benignity via established ACMG/AMP combination rules, including population frequency, in silico evidence codes, and case-control signal. We apply this framework to eight hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes, demonstrating that systematically generated benign missense truthsets allow maximum application of PS3 at greater (or equivalent) strength-reaching \"moderate\" for CHEK2 and \"strong\" for the other seven genes-than those derived from ClinVar ≥2\n",
