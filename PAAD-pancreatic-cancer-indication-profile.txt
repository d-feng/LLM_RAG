      "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents 90% of pancreatic cancers and is characterized by a notoriously immunosuppressive and fibrotic tumor microenvironment. The hallmark is dense desmoplastic stroma (comprising 60-90% of tumor mass) created by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which physically excludes T-cells and creates metabolic barriers. PDAC is intrinsically 'cold' with minimal T-cell infiltration in 80-90% of tumors, driven by: (1) Low mutational burden (median TMB 1-2 mut/Mb, 10-fold lower than melanoma/NSCLC), (2) Immunosuppressive metabolites (adenosine, lactate, kynurenine), (3) Regulatory immune cells (Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages comprising 40-60% of immune infiltrate). Universal KRAS mutations (90-95%) drive oncogenesis but attempts at therapeutic targeting have historically failed until recent G12C inhibitors in other tumors. PDAC is highly resistant to immunotherapy monotherapy (checkpoint inhibitor ORR <5% in unselected patients) but emerging data show combination approaches targeting TME can convert cold to hot.",
