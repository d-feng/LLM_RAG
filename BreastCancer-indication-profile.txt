Biological rationale is COMPELLING - CAF autophagy, TGF-β, lactate/lactylation all validated resistance mechanisms (recent 2024-2025 data). However, NO approved TME-directed therapies exist; all programs early-stage. STRATEGIC CHALLENGES: (1) TME complexity - may need multi-targeted approach, (2) Biomarker development essential (TME-high tumors for patient selection), (3) Combination strategies required (TME modulator + ICI), (4) Toxicity risks with systemic exposure. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES: (1) First-in-class potential (no competition), (2) Addresses 60-70% of NSCLC that doesn't respond to ICIs ('cold' tumors), (3) Could convert ICI non-responders to responders. RECOMMENDATION: HIGH SCIENTIFIC PRIORITY but CAUTIOUS INVESTMENT - support early research, biomarker development, and rational combination designs. Expect long development timelines and high attrition. Partner with academic centers for mechanistic studies. TME modulators are FUTURE direction but not near-term commercial opportunity."
