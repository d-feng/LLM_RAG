The Preclinical Promise vs Clinical Reality Gap
TIGIT looked fantastic preclinically:

Clear immunosuppressive mechanism via CD155/CD112 binding
Expressed on exhausted T cells and NK cells in tumors
Synergy with PD-1 blockade in mouse models
Poliovirus receptor family biology seemed druggable

Yet clinical trials largely failed. Let's dissect why.
Critical Failure Points
1. Species-Specific Biology Differences
The mouse models that validated TIGIT may have fundamentally misled us:

Mouse vs human CD155/CD112/CD226/TIGIT interaction affinities differ
The competitive balance between TIGIT and CD226 (DNAM-1) for CD155 binding may not translate
Mouse tumor microenvironments don't recapitulate human immune exhaustion states accurately
The preclinical models used immunogenic tumors that don't represent most human "cold" tumors

2. The PD-1/PD-L1 Resistance Mechanism Problem
Here's a crucial insight: TIGIT blockade was positioned as a way to overcome PD-1 resistance, but:

If tumors are PD-1 resistant due to lack of T cell infiltration (immune desert), adding TIGIT blockade doesn't help - there are no T cells to rescue
If resistance is due to alternative checkpoint upregulation, TIGIT alone may be insufficient
If resistance involves antigen presentation defects (β2M loss, HLA loss), no checkpoint blockade will work
The mutational burden/neoantigen quality in PD-1 refractory patients may be fundamentally insufficient

3. Ligand Biology Complexity
The CD155/CD112 system is more complex than initially appreciated:

CD155 is upregulated on many cancer cells - but its functional significance varies
CD96 (another inhibitory receptor) also binds CD155, potentially compensating when TIGIT is blocked
CD226 (DNAM-1) competes with TIGIT for CD155 - but the actual ratio and functional outcome in human tumors may differ from models
Soluble CD155 may exist and could act as a decoy, reducing antibody efficacy

4. Antibody-Specific Issues
Not all TIGIT antibodies are equal:

Fc effector function - some antibodies deplete TIGIT+ cells (bad if you're trying to activate them), others don't
Epitope specificity - binding location affects whether the antibody truly blocks the CD155 interaction
Affinity/avidity - may be insufficient to compete with endogenous ligand binding in the TME
Tiragolumab, vibostolimab, domvanalimab - each has different properties that could explain differential failure rates

5. Patient Selection Failures
This is critical for your work:

Trials didn't stratify by TIGIT expression levels effectively
No biomarker for CD155 expression on tumor/stromal cells
Didn't select for CD226+ T cell presence (the co-stimulatory partner)
PD-L1 status alone is insufficient - need integrated immune contexture
Prior PD-1 therapy may have fundamentally altered the TME in ways we don't understand

6. The Combination Hypothesis Problem
The trials were built on "PD-1 + TIGIT > PD-1 alone" but:

In PD-1 naive patients: Adding TIGIT to PD-1 may not add benefit if PD-1 alone would work
In PD-1 refractory patients: The resistance mechanism may be TIGIT-independent
The trial designs often couldn't distinguish these scenarios
Statistical powering assumed additive effects that may not exist biologically

7. Tumor Type Specificity
TIGIT biology may vary dramatically by cancer type:

NSCLC - the main testing ground, but is it the right tumor type?
TME architecture differs: NSCLC vs melanoma vs RCC vs HCC
Some tumors may use CD155-independent immune evasion
The checkpoint hierarchy may place TIGIT lower in importance for certain cancers

The Mechanistic Deep Dive
Exhaustion Biology Nuance
T cell exhaustion isn't one state - it's a spectrum:

Progenitor exhausted (TCF1+, PD-1 intermediate) - can be rescued
Terminally exhausted (TCF1-, PD-1 high, TIM-3+, TIGIT+) - may be beyond rescue

TIGIT is expressed on both, but adding TIGIT blockade to PD-1 blockade may primarily help the progenitor population - which PD-1 blockade alone already rescues. The terminally exhausted cells may need more than dual checkpoint blockade.
The CD226/TIGIT Balance Theory
In mice: Blocking TIGIT shifts balance toward CD226 co-stimulation.
In humans:

CD226 may already be downregulated or dysfunctional in exhausted cells
Genetic polymorphisms in CD226 affect function
Simply removing TIGIT inhibition doesn't guarantee CD226-mediated activation if CD226 itself is impaired

NK Cell Story
TIGIT is on NK cells, and blocking it could enhance NK-mediated tumor cell killing:

But many tumors have low MHC-I (which would activate NK cells anyway)
NK cell infiltration in many solid tumors is limited
The antibody Fc effects on NK cells might be more important than TIGIT blockade itself

What the Failures Teach Us
For Your Target Selection Work:

Mechanism validation needs human tissue: Mouse models are hypothesis-generating, not validating
Biomarker-driven design is essential: Need to measure target, ligand, competing pathways, and effector cell presence
Context matters: Checkpoint hierarchy differs by tumor type, treatment history, and immune contexture
Resistance mechanism heterogeneity: One mechanism rarely explains all PD-1 failures
Combination rationale must be biological, not just additive: Need mechanistic synergy evidence

The Broader Implications:
The TIGIT failure represents a class problem in immuno-oncology:

Preclinical-clinical translation gap for checkpoint biology
Biomarker-free trial design leading to diluted signals
Assumption that checkpoint co-expression = functional redundancy
Insufficient understanding of human TME biology

What Might Have Worked Differently?
Better trial design:

Enrich for TIGIT+ CD8+ T cells in tumors
Require CD155+ on tumor cells
Stratify by CD226 expression/function
Select PD-1 naive patients in specific tumor types where TIGIT biology is validated in human samples
Adaptive trial design with interim biomarker analysis

Better antibodies:

Optimize for blocking without depletion
Ensure true CD155 interaction blockade
Consider bispecific approaches

Better biological understanding:

Identify which exhaustion states respond
Map the checkpoint hierarchy in human tumors
Understand ligand biology in human TME
Account for stromal vs tumor CD155

The Bottom Line
TIGIT failed not because the biology is wrong, but because:

We oversimplified the mechanism based on mouse data
We ran biomarker-agnostic trials in heterogeneous populations
The resistance mechanisms we hoped to overcome weren't TIGIT-dependent
The drug development (antibodies) may have been suboptimal
We tested in the wrong patient populations or tumor types

For your work: This is a cautionary tale about mechanism validation in human biology, biomarker-driven development, and the critical importance of understanding resistance heterogeneity. The target selection framework needs to incorporate human tissue validation, competitive pathway analysis, and clear patient selection criteria from the start.
The TIGIT story isn't closed - better patient selection and combinations might still work - but it's a powerful lesson in humility about translating preclinical immunology to clinical benefit.
