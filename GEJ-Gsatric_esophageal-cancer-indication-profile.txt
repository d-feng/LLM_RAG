      "summary": "Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers are adenocarcinomas arising within 5 cm of the anatomical junction between esophagus and stomach. They share biological features with both esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and gastric cancer (GC), and are often grouped together in clinical trials. The treatment paradigm has been revolutionized by immuno-oncology - checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 are now standard-of-care in first-line settings for biomarker-selected populations. Unlike GBM (immunologically 'cold'), GEJ/gastric cancers represent a spectrum: (1) MSI-H tumors are 'hot' with high TMB and excellent checkpoint responses, (2) EBV-associated tumors are PD-L1 high and responsive, (3) PD-L1+ tumors (CPS ≥1 or ≥5) show benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, (4) Biomarker-negative tumors remain challenging. HER2-targeted therapies (trastuzumab, T-DXd ADC) are established for HER2+ disease. Emerging targets include CLDN18.2 (40-60% prevalence) and TROP2, with ADCs showing breakthrough efficacy (ORR 30-43%) in Phase I/II trials.",
